# Web-scraping project

In this project, I learn how to scrap from website. 
There are some framework that can be used:
* Selenium: Can apply to scrap dynamic sites
* Scrapy: fast, powerful and handle large data
* Beautifulsoup: can apply to small project, is beginner-friendly but slow and require few more dependencies
